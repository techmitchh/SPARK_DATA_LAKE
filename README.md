# Project: Spark Data Lake
##### **Tools:** *Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pyspark, Spark.SQL, AWS S3a, AWS EMR, AWS EC2, JSON, Parquet*

***

#### Project Overview

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

I'll be able to test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify.

#### Data Overview

There are 2 Datasets, `(SONG_DATA and lOG_DATA)`, and they're located in an S3 bucket. Combined these datasets represent users song choice in JSON format.

###### `SONG_DATA` dataset contents:
- *num_songs | artist_id |artist_latitude | artist_longitude | artist_location | artist_name | song_id, title | duration | year*

###### `LOG_DATA` dataset contents:
- *artist | auth | firstName | gender | itemInSession | lastName | length | level | location | method | page | registration | sessionId | song | status | ts | userAgent | userId*
